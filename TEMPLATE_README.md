*We recognize that building a beautiful and convincing website is not a
simple or speedy task, which is why we'd like to see what future
improvements you would suggest to get this project to a 100% production
ready state. No suggestion is a bad one, and we welcome every detail you

ðŸ”¥ Improve triggering sync between scroll & active hero heading. The timing could be improved, meaning, only trigger active if the section is scrolled to the top.

ðŸ”¥ Improve Accordion toggle animation: icon transformation and animated collapse/expand.

ðŸ”¥ Improve code organization: as `StickyHero` and `NavigationBar` become more complicated, we can move them into its own file.

ðŸ”¥ Other design details e.g. spacing pixel perfecting, typography.
