### Assignment Details

Your task is to create a fully functional landing page inspired by the provided [Dribble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/21938162-Services-scroll-interaction) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A folder with assets has been provided for you to use in your implementation. Note that the `mocks` folder is only for referenceâ€”please avoid directly incorporating it in your code.

#### Key Requirements

1. **Landing Page Implementation**:
   - Construct the page layout and styling based on the design reference, but feel free to use placeholder content instead of real text. The focus should be on capturing the ðŸ”¥ structure and ðŸ”¥ visual details of the design.
   - Demonstrate your knowledge of **semantic HTML**, **CSS best practices**, and **JavaScript** semantics.

2. **Background Guilloche Pattern**:
   - Use the provided guilloche (turning/interwoven line) pattern in the background of the page.
   - Apply a subtle **animation or movement** to the pattern, allowing space for creativity in how you choose to animate or style this element.

3. **Static Web Page**:
   - Vanilla CSS, HTML, and JS are preferred, but you can also use libraries or meta framework of your choice. We use Next.js at Plaid, but you can use whatever you're comfortable with. 
   - The focus of this assignment is to take a design mockup to a production ready static or SSR web page. 
   - We care about SEO so the end result should not be a (SPA) single page application.

#### Additional Considerations

In addition to replicating the design and adding the animated pattern, this assignment is an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of web development best practices. Focus on implementing a performant, accessible, and well-structured page.

This project is designed to showcase your ability to interpret a design concept into code while using your judgment to apply web development principles effectively.


### Criteria
- **Completeness**: is your implementation complete to the specifications and
  mockups?
- **Correctness**: does it follow HTML, JS and CSS best practices? Is it written
  in a clean, maintainable way?
- **Aesthetically pleasing**: does it closely follow the design mockups?

### Not required

- We know there is limited time and that browser compatibility and responsive design are a
  time-consuming task. Focus on a single platform and environment ONLY
  (such as Chrome on OS X)


### Timeline

We're expecting this to take between 5 to 6 hours to complete. You'll be given
48 hours to submit the task after receiving this prompt.
